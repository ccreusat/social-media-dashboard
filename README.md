## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript

### What I learned

Using TypeScript for the first time. Wasn't easy but gives the opportunity to write a better and typed code.

### Useful resources

-   [TypeScript and React Hooks](https://fettblog.eu/typescript-react/hooks/) - A perfect guide to TypeScript in ReactJS and examples.
